# ## Assignment:
# - Please get any data of ECG, EEG and EMG from the internet. Write your own code to extract respiration signals from the data.
# - ECG data is already given as part of Assignment 2. To download EMG data, see lecture 5 slides. EEG data can be acquired from:
# http://www.bbci.de/competition/.
# - Please submit a report with code and results of the extracted data

# # Respiratory signal from EEG

# ## Dataset
# 
# - BCI Competition 2008 â€“ Graz dataset A (http://bbci.de/competition/iv/desc_2a.pdf) is used. 
# - This data set consists of EEG data from 9 subjects.
# - The signals were sampled with 250 Hz.
# - The signal variable contains 25 channels (the first 22 are EEG and the last 3 are EOG signals).

# ## Importing the dataset

# In[2]:


filepath = 'A01T_slice.mat'
arrays = {}
f = h5py.File(filepath)
for k, v in f.items():
    arrays[k] = np.array(v)


# The arrays variable contains two variable, image and type. Image var contains the signals and type var contains the classes and header information. Our main concern is getting an EEG signal, so we will select it from the array.

# In[3]:


arrays["image"].shape


# Here, 288 is the no trials per session, 25 shows the number of channels (22 EEg, 3 EOG), and the last var contains the respective EEG signal value.
# 
# Lets select trial 10 and electrode 20.

# In[4]:


EEG_signal = arrays["image"][10][20]


# ## Plotting the signal

# In[5]:


fs = 250
time = np.arange(EEG_signal.size) / fs
plt.plot(time, EEG_signal)
plt.xlabel("time in s")
plt.ylabel("EEG in mV")
plt.xlim(min(time), max(time))
plt.ylim(min(EEG_signal), max(EEG_signal))
plt.show()


# ## Applying a bandpass filter of range 0.1-0.6 Hz

# In[6]:


badpass_low, bandpass_high = 0.1, 0.6
EEG_signal = EEG_signal.astype("float64")
EEG_signal_filtered = filter_data(EEG_signal, fs, badpass_low, bandpass_high, verbose=1)

fs = 250
time = np.arange(EEG_signal_filtered.size) / fs
plt.plot(time, EEG_signal_filtered)
plt.xlabel("time in s")
plt.ylabel("EEG in mV")
plt.xlim(min(time), max(time))
plt.ylim(min(EEG_signal_filtered), max(EEG_signal_filtered))
plt.show()


# ## Power spectrum

# At this stage, we are not sure if the respiration signal is present or not, therefore we will take the power spectrum of the signal.

# In[7]:


plt.psd(EEG_signal_filtered, 250, 1/0.2 ) 
plt.show()


# ## Conclusion

# We can see above that there is no peak and 0.6 Hz, therefore we can say that there is no respiration signal present in this EEG signal.
# 
# I also tried other EEG signals from the dataset and the results were same as above.

# - The dataset contains 2 channels and 10 classes.
# - This dataset consists of EMG data from 8 subjects.
# - The signals were sampled with 4000 Hz.

# As we can see, there is a peak at 0.54 Hz, showing the presence of respiratory signal.
